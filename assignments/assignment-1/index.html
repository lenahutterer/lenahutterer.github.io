          <p>
            For this comparison the two Apps that have been chosen are "Whatsapp" and "Telegram". Both serve the same
            purpose of being a communication application for primarily text messaging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both applications offer a web-based version that can easily be accessed through a web browser. In order to
            do so you simply have to scan the QR code that is provided on the computer screen through the App on your
            phone. I knew how to do it on Whatsapp since I have been using it for several years now as opposed to
            Telegram which I have only been using for a couple of months now - but they surprisingly worked exactly
            identical - this made it very easy for me to figure it out!

            1. The Chat Function: you have a list of your different chats to either a single person or a group-chat.
            Whithin this menu it is also possible to start a new chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. The Calls Function: you can have calls through this app with either audio only or even video. Other than
            calling someone over phone as you would usually, you can call someone using only wifi or mobile data.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. The Status Function: similar to Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. you can post some sort of a "story"
            where you share a photo with some text on your profile for everyone to view it. There is even a function to
            reply or react to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. The Camera Function: by clicking on the camera icon you can take a photo and then choose to whom you want
            to send it.

            What the user can controll & change:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. I can change my appearance in terms of changing my profile picture, my name that appears to the
            chat-partners, my phone number and my "caption" or "about".
          </p>
          <p>
            2. I can choose which devices I want to link to my account. This can either be another phone, my laptop
            application or the web based application.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. I can choose whether to back-up my chats, or to have it automatically done; move them to another phone
            (even from iphone to android); archive them; clear them from my phone or delete them all.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. I can manage my storage. I can choose some of the above options to do so or get an insight on the usage
            that is being displayed for me; I can also choose to use less data for calls and if I want the app to use my
            Cellular or Wifi only.

            5. Since this App is very straight forward and makes good use or its architecture, there is not much
            guidance or aid. There is only a small section in the "settings" section that indicated more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. In this small section you have a limited selection of help that you can choose from.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. You can contact someone or something (if it is a bot) either via your profile on your phone or via
            e-mail.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            1. The only real change that a user can make to the interface is to change the wallpaper, which is the
            background for your chats. Other than that you can only choose the ringtone for the app notifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. & 3. With this app it is a little bit difficul to find out whether it is a "deductive" or an "inductive"
            design. Since this is an app that most of the users are familiar, it is very deductive - it also uses a lot
            of icons instead of descriptions and there is no "walk through" or "help" button on the "landing page" or
            "first page".

            2. The Connecting Function: Here you have the possibility to find people nearby - since the user does not
            need the other persons number this is a handy tool. You can also invite friends from your contact list.

          <p>
            2. I can set/change my profile picture or even a video.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. I can link different devices to my account.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. I can create different chat folders to group them together.

            5. There are three different options that can bring you the needed support.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. When you want to ask a question there is a disclaimer that you will be chatting to a bot - which is nice
            to point out but strange to get help from a machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            7. There is also an online FAQ section that you will get directed to in case your question has been asked
            before.
          </p>
          <p>
            8. If you want a short induction or tutorial to the app it can be found here - though it is very hidden and
            not clear from the title what it actually is.

            1. The Interface can be changed when clicking on the "appearance" button.

          <p>
            2. There you can choose a chat theme, create your own chat theme and edit an existing or create a new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. The Background for the chats can also be edited seperately.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. The text size can be selected to the users needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Even the corners of the little speech bubbles can be altered.
          </p>
          <p>
            6. The App icon which appears on your phone can also be customized and changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Telegram is like Whatsapp hard to define when it comes to a deductive or inductive design but like Whatsapp
            it uses the advantage of the users experience and the help of little icons all over the page.

              </p>
              <p>
                To my mind, both of these two Apps have a very progressive disclosure. Both show what is most relevant
                which is the "chats" and the less relevant options are hidden away behind "icons" either on the bottom
                in a bar or in the corners of the screen. These icons also symbolize a "group" of actions, in that way
                the user knows exactly where to find what he/she needs and knows where to look for it even when he/she
                is unsure.
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4 class="text-center m-6">Authorization Process</h4>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Authorization Processs for the phone application is a little bit different between these apps. For
                Whatsapp one has to put in their phone number which is a huge deal when it comes to privacy especially
                when it is also connected with your name. Telegram on the other hand has the advantage that it operated
                without phone numbers but simply with an online user profile which is especially appealing for either
                business use or usage for big groups like university sports clubs where there are often over 300 people
                from all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                For loging into the web-based application the user simply has to scan the QR code that is displayed on
                the computer screen with the phone through the app and is automatically logged in.
