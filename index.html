          This application is all about sustainability and eco friendly living. It is an app that fuctions as a guide and inspiration plattform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user can choose from different topics that each contain a variety of blog posts that can be read through and sometimes provide a link to a retailing website or an other kind of webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to use the app, the user has to sign-up and provide their email, address and phone number for easy contacting. This also helps when the user wants to submit a comment. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The types of interactions within the app are quite diverse. They include: Signing-Up or Logging-In; Saving interesting Blog Posts to their own "My Green Life" tab to review them later; a comment section for submitting interesting topics that the "Green Me" team can then turn into a new Blog Post; Clicking on the "Instagram" button to be redirected to the instagram page; and links to the indiviual websites and retail pages that the blog posts are referring to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Green Me" can be used offline and online - the only thing is, that new Blog Posts can only be read when there is a working internet connection as the application has to communicate with the server to update the posts. Already saved posts can be read offline as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app itself requires a smartphone and can be downloaded in the app-store and on google-play. There is also a webpage that offers the same blogs etc.

          <img class="img-fluid" src="assignment-4/photo 1.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing the user has to do is to log in or as a first-time-user, to sign up!
        </p>
        <p>
          The signing-up-process can either be started by clicking on the "Join Now" button at the landing page or simply ba clicking on the button that says "Sign-up/Log-in" on the upper right corner of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the user clicked on one of the buttons to sign-up, he or she will be directed to a page where they have to type in their personal information that will then be saved to the app under the personal page where it can always be altered and changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the information is provided the user can click on a button to save everything. Then a text will show up that shows the user that the saving process was successful. It also provides a button that directs the user to the landing page to start using the app.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user is only logging-in, there will not be a special welcoming sign but once the usr clicks on the button "log in" he or she will simply be directed to the landing page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assignment-4/photo 2.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
          On the upper left corner there is an icon that symbolizes a menu. It is present on every page and therefore can be accessed in every step.
        </p>
        <p>
          By clicking on the icon a full menu will drop down and the user can click on a tab of choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three main tabs are "My Green Life", the personal page; "Topics", that includes the Blog; and "Contact" where the user can also submit a comment on top of getting a contact address, telephone number, email address and a link to the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="assignment-4/photo 3.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>
          By clicking on the "Topics" tab in the drop-down-menu, the user will be directed to a page that provides five different topics to choose from. Each of them contains a variety of blog posts and links to websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          By clicking on one of the five topics the user will be directed to the "Blog Page" where they can choose a blog to read by clicking on the button "read more" that is provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Blog Post will be different as each is about a different topic. Some might provide links, some just text and pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user likes a post and wants to remember it, they can click a button at the end of the post that says "Save to my page". The saved posts will then be in the "My Green Life" section in the app under "Saved Blog Posts" and can be read again and easily found again. The user can also read them offline.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          The app provides two bars that stay the same and cann be accessed wherever the user is within the application. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The upper one contains the menu bar and the sign-up/log-in. The lower one contains a "Logo Button" that redirects the user to the landing page, an "Instagram" button that redirects the user to the instagram page, a "Comment" button that leads the user to the commenting and contact page and a "Person" button that will show the "My Green Life" personal page.

        <p>
          The concept of Blog Posts that can be saved and reviewed on a personal page, can be compared to "Pinterest". "Instagram" also provides a saving function and is actually an app that almost exclusively shows blog posts with pictures. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of the menu and the "topics" section is a generally used concept, especially in apps by clothing brands to categorize clothing types, to divide each topic and make it more clear what the user will get by clicking on the individual buttons/topics.
